This article is a reflection assignment as part of the "COMP 4461: Human-Computer Interaction" course at HKUST. This reflection is written for Project 3 (Social XR for local communities).

## Background

We were required to develop an XR (extended reality) solution for a specific community for their 'social' needs. The highlight of this project was working with such a 'cutting-edge' technology like virtual reality.

## Empathize

We kicked off brainstorming by discussing about what community we would want to target. We considered the following communities: Local artists and Shoppers.

Our initial ideas were around these community members because we were able to get a feel for their problems, however, after conducting some secondary research, we were quick to realize that our ideas didn't have a real need.

That is when we started thinking about university students as a community given that all of us in the team are university students.

Within university students, we focused on community of international students, since all three of us in the group are international.

## Interpret

Based on the empathy research, we synthesized our findings to clearly define the core problems Ortus should address. We identified key issues such as difficulty in navigating complex interfaces and the need for adaptable interaction modes to accommodate diverse users. This problem statement guided the direction of our design efforts.

With a clear problem in mind, we brainstormed a variety of ideas to enhance user interaction. We explored concepts like multimodal controls, direct manipulation features, and customizable user interfaces. Collaborative sessions encouraged creativity and helped us select the most promising solutions that balanced innovation and usability.

## Prototyping

We translated our ideas into a working prototype of Ortus. This interactive model incorporated features such as zooming, rotating, and selecting elements with intuitive gestures, designed to minimize cognitive load and maximize accessibility. The prototype allowed us to visualize and test the systemâ€™s core functionalities early in the process.

It was built using Unity and Spatial as demonstrated in the lab.

## Personal Reflection

Over the past few weeks, diving into the design thinking cycle through this project has been a truly eye-opening experience. Initially, I found the concepts a bit abstract during lectures, especially when it came to applying them in a practical context like virtual reality. However, working hands-on with Unity to develop Ortus allowed me to connect theory with practice and gain a much clearer understanding of each phase of the design thinking process and the importance of keeping the user at the center of our design.

Looking back, I realize that my team and I underestimated the time required for the prototyping phase, particularly because VR development in Unity presented unique challenges that slowed us down. This caused us to rush through some testing and refinement stages, which I think impacted the overall polish of the final product. If I were to take one key lesson from this project, it would be to establish stricter internal deadlines for each design thinking phase and allocate more time for iterative testing, especially when working with complex technologies like VR.

On a personal note, I took on most of the responsibilities related to building the prototype in Unity, integrating VR interactions, as well as conducting user interviews and facilitating usability testing sessions. This hands-on involvement not only improved my technical skills but also deepened my appreciation for the iterative nature of human-centered design in immersive environments.

## AI Usage

We did not use AI resources in developing this project since we felt there was no need.
